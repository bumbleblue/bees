### Why "The Bees' Knees"?

“The bees’ knees” is an old-fashioned expression for something like “cool”. Example: “This cocktail is amazing!” “Oh yeah, it's the bees’ knees!”

### What is barbershop, anyway?

[Barbershop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbershop_music) is four-part close harmony singing. You may have seen a barbershop quartet before without realizing it: They appear in [The Music Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0DFttQoJc), in [Scrubs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN8vA_bulss), on [Jimmy Fallon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-4FtBjjelA). Barbershop music is full of seventh chords, syncopations, and play between the different voices. The four parts of barbershop singing are tenor, lead, baritone, and bass. Singing barbershop can be a challenge, but that's what makes it fun! As Deke Sharon puts it: [It's the martial arts of a cappella singing.](http://www.casa.org/content/acamartialart)
