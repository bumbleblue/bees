## Who we are

We are a German-American quartet from Berlin that has sung together in various constellations since 2013. We sing at different private and public occasions and also participate in contests. We constantly work to improve our sound and performance. Download a recording of us [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1qWGtqQgRgkam1ITWZfTlo0UU0/view?usp=sharing).

One of us will be leaving next year. Since it takes four to barbershop, we are looking for someone who's just as passionate about music as we are!

* You have some experience in singing, especially in choirs and/or ensembles.
* Complex harmonies don't scare you.

* Singing in American English is not a problem for you.
* You're reliable and yet flexible.
* You live in (Großraum) Berlin.
* You're available and excited about participating in the annual Quartet College, hosted by [BinG!](http://www.barbershop.de/de/news/index.html) during the first October weekend.

## Why sing with us

* We're an experienced quartet that has been singing together and performing for audiences for over three years now. We blend well, and we have accumulated a lot of musical expertise.
* We sing many <a href="#songs">cool songs</a>. But we're also open to your suggestions!

## FAQ

<a name="barbershop">

### What is barbershop, anyway?

Barbershop is four-part close harmony singing. You may have seen a barbershop quartet before without realizing it: They appear in [The Music Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0DFttQoJc), in [Scrubs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN8vA_bulss), on [Jimmy Fallon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-4FtBjjelA). Barbershop music is full of seventh chords, syncopations, and play between the different voices. The four parts of barbershop singing are tenor, lead, baritone, and bass. More information on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbershop_music).

Singing barbershop can be a challenge, but that's what makes it fun! As Deke Sharon puts it: [It's the martial arts of a cappella singing.](http://www.casa.org/content/acamartialart)

### Why "The Bees' Knees"?

"The bees' knees" is an old-fashioned expression for something like "cool".
Example: "These waffles are amazing!" "Oh yeah, they're the bees' knees!"

### Do I have to be a woman to sing with you?

Short answer: no. Write us an email and we'll figure something out!
