... we will follow! We are **The Bees' Knees**, a women's a cappella group in Berlin, and we are looking for a new lead. That's a person who sings the melody part in a <a href="#barbershop">barbershop</a> quartet. If you enjoy high-level singing, close harmonies, and sappy love songs, you should definitely come to our audition in January 2017!

## Who we are

We are a quartet that has sung together in different constellations since 2013 (???). We sing at different private and public occasions and also participate in contests. We constantly work to improve our sound and performance.

Sadly, our lead will be leaving us next year. Since it takes four to barbershop, we are looking for another person who's just as passionate about music as we are.

## What we are looking for

* You like singing melodies, and you love performing songs. You are a bit of a Rampensau.
* You have some experience in singing, especially in choirs and/or ensembles.
* You're comfortable singing in the range of C5 to C6 (roughly soprano I and II).
* You speak English fluently.
